# Code Quality Improvement Tasks

This list tracks potential improvements for code quality, readability, and maintainability of the project.

1. **Expand Documentation**: Update `README.md` with a project overview, setup instructions, and document the cloud functions better in `cloud_functions/README.md`.
2. **Enforce Consistent Formatting**: Configure Prettier with a sensible `printWidth` and integrate it into a pre-commit hook or CI job.
3. **Add Linting**: Introduce ESLint with consistent rules for both the React frontend and cloud functions.
4. **Convert Cloud Functions to TypeScript**: Migrate JavaScript files in `cloud_functions/functions/` to TypeScript for type safety.
5. **Introduce Unit Tests**: Add tests for utility functions and critical components to prevent regressions.
6. **Set Up Continuous Integration**: Add a workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run linting, tests, and build steps on pull requests.
7. **Improve Code Organization**: Group related components in `src` into subdirectories and keep components small and focused.
8. **Centralize Configuration**: Use a `.env.example` or configuration module to manage environment variables clearly.
9. **Document Important Patterns**: Comment on patterns such as the custom board overlay logic in `src/ui/BoardComponent.tsx` to help new contributors.
10. **Review Dependency Versions and Security**: Regularly update dependencies and document the process; consider using dependabot.
