# Project Improvement Tasks - Deep Review Analysis

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive deep review of the mons codebase, I've identified critical areas for improvement across architecture, code organization, and quality. This is a feature-rich React gaming application with Firebase backend, but it suffers from architectural debt, scattered state management, and organizational issues that impede maintainability and scalability.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Architecture Issues

### 1. State Management Overhaul
**Priority: Critical**

**Current Issues:**
- Heavy reliance on global variables and module-level state (`gameController.ts`, `board.ts`)
- State scattered across 50+ exported functions from `BottomControls.tsx`
- Complex coupling between UI components and game logic
- No centralized state management system

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Implement centralized state management** (Zustand or Redux Toolkit)
  - Create game state store (`gameStore.ts`)
  - Create UI state store (`uiStore.ts`) 
  - Create user/auth state store (`authStore.ts`)
- [ ] **Eliminate global variables** in `gameController.ts` (40+ globals identified)
- [ ] **Refactor BottomControls.tsx** to use centralized state instead of 25+ exported setter functions
- [ ] **Create proper React Context** for game data that needs component sharing
- [ ] **Implement state persistence** layer for game state recovery

### 2. Component Architecture Restructure
**Priority: Critical**

**Current Issues:**
- Monolithic components with mixed responsibilities
- `board.ts` (1500+ lines) handles rendering, state, and game logic
- `gameController.ts` (1400+ lines) mixes business logic with UI concerns

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Split board.ts into focused modules:**
  - `BoardRenderer.tsx` (rendering logic)
  - `BoardState.ts` (state management)
  - `BoardInteractions.ts` (user interactions)
  - `BoardAnimations.ts` (visual effects)
- [ ] **Decompose gameController.ts:**
  - `GameEngine.ts` (core game logic)
  - `GameEvents.ts` (event handling)
  - `GameNetwork.ts` (multiplayer sync)
  - `GameModes.ts` (puzzle, bot, online modes)
- [ ] **Create proper component hierarchy:**
  - `GameProvider` (top-level game context)
  - `BoardContainer` â†’ `Board` â†’ `Square` components
  - Separate UI controls from game components

### 3. Module Boundaries & Separation of Concerns
**Priority: High**

**Current Issues:**
- Business logic mixed with UI rendering
- Network layer tightly coupled to UI components
- Game engine logic spread across multiple files

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Establish clear layer boundaries:**
  ```
  /src
    /core (game engine, pure logic)
    /features (game modes, user management)
    /ui (components, styling)
    /services (API, storage, external)
    /utils (helpers, utilities)
  ```
- [ ] **Create abstraction layers:**
  - Game engine interface
  - Network service interface
  - Storage service interface
- [ ] **Implement dependency inversion** for easier testing

## ðŸŸ¡ Code Organization & Structure

### 4. File Organization Restructure
**Priority: High**

**Current Issues:**
- Flat component structure in `/ui`
- Mixed concerns in single directories
- No clear feature grouping

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Reorganize by feature/domain:**
  ```
  /src
    /features
      /game-board
      /user-profile  
      /multiplayer
      /puzzles
      /settings
    /shared
      /components
      /hooks
      /utils
  ```
- [ ] **Create index files** for clean imports
- [ ] **Establish naming conventions** (PascalCase components, camelCase utilities)
- [ ] **Group related functionality** together

### 5. Asset Management & Performance
**Priority: Medium**

**Current Issues:**
- Multiple asset loading patterns (`gameAssets*.ts`)
- No lazy loading or code splitting
- Large bundle size potential

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Implement dynamic asset loading:**
  - Lazy load game assets based on selected theme
  - Code split by game mode
- [ ] **Optimize bundle size:**
  - Implement React.lazy for large components
  - Split vendor and app bundles
  - Add bundle analysis tools
- [ ] **Create asset management system:**
  - Centralized asset loader
  - Asset preloading strategies
  - Error handling for failed loads

### 6. TypeScript & Type Safety
**Priority: Medium**

**Current Issues:**
- Inconsistent typing patterns
- `any` types in several places
- Missing interface definitions

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Strengthen type definitions:**
  - Create comprehensive game state types
  - Define API response/request types
  - Add strict event handler types
- [ ] **Eliminate `any` types** throughout codebase
- [ ] **Add generic types** for reusable components
- [ ] **Implement stricter TypeScript config:**
  - Enable `noImplicitAny`
  - Enable `strictNullChecks`
  - Add `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`

## ðŸŸ¢ Code Quality & Best Practices

### 7. Testing Implementation
**Priority: High**

**Current Issues:**
- No test files found in the codebase
